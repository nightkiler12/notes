++ Blockchain Intuition ++

>> What is a BlockChain? <<
- a block chain is a countiously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured with crptography
- a block(record) 1.Data: "Hello World", 2.Prev.Hash:22131DW, 3.Hash:DW2131WD
- first block is the genesis block which ahs no previous hash.
- the records are linked with the prev.hash
- words to know Mining, Consensus Protocal, Hash Cryptography, Distributed P2P Network, Immutable Ledger

>> Understanding Sha56 Hash <<
- NSA made SHA56 Hash
- 64 character works with anything digital 
-- Five Requirements for Hash algorithims --
- 1. One Way= can't go backwards to find information
- 2. Deterministic= get the exact same result
- 3. Fast Computation
- 4. The Avalanche Effect= even if a single piece of the data is change the hash will change completely
- 5. Must withstand collisons= (Pigeon hole principle- very unlikely) - avoid artifical collisions not natural (like if someone got the same data on personal information)

>> Immutable Ledger <<
- Traditional Ledger= basically written on paper like a deed and if the government has an error in the regristration you basically don't own the house even if you have the deed
- a immutable ledger is basically when you try to temper with information in a blockchain and you can't because it would be to difficult
- the more time passees the harder it is to change

>> Distributed P2P Network <<
- all computers on the blockahin are interconnected and blockchain are copied to all computers on the network
- basically in a p2p if a hacker changes your blockchain on your blockchain will change back beacuse it checks with other blockhains on other computers and if its different it will change
