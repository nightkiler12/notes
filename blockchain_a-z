++ Blockchain Intuition ++

>> What is a BlockChain? <<
- a block chain is a countiously growing list of records called blocks, which are linked and secured with crptography
- a block(record) 1.Data: "Hello World", 2.Prev.Hash:22131DW, 3.Hash:DW2131WD
- first block is the genesis block which ahs no previous hash.
- the records are linked with the prev.hash
- words to know Mining, Consensus Protocal, Hash Cryptography, Distributed P2P Network, Immutable Ledger

>> Understanding Sha56 Hash <<
- NSA made SHA56 Hash
- 64 character works with anything digital 
-- Five Requirements for Hash algorithims --
- 1. One Way= can't go backwards to find information
- 2. Deterministic= get the exact same result
- 3. Fast Computation
- 4. The Avalanche Effect= even if a single piece of the data is change the hash will change completely
- 5. Must withstand collisons= (Pigeon hole principle- very unlikely) - avoid artifical collisions not natural (like if someone got the same data on personal information)

>> Immutable Ledger <<
- Traditional Ledger= basically written on paper like a deed and if the government has an error in the regristration you basically don't own the house even if you have the deed
- a immutable ledger is basically when you try to temper with information in a blockchain and you can't because it would be to difficult
- the more time passees the harder it is to change

>> Distributed P2P Network <<
- all computers on the blockahin are interconnected and blockchain are copied to all computers on the network
- basically in a p2p if a hacker changes your blockchain on your blockchain will change back beacuse it checks with other blockhains on other computers and if its different it will change

>> How Mining Works <<
-- Nonce --
- Nonce is gives extra control over hash value (avalanche effect)
-- Cryptographic Puzzle --
- a hash a number or hexadecimal number and is always 64 characters
- there is a target set to solve for a hash and should be solved which is basically created just for miners
- basically miners change the nonce till they can give a block that is below the target or on the target

>> Byzantine Fault Tolerance <<
- four knights and a castle example with one person being a traitor no more than 1/3 can be a traitor for this algorithim to work
- there is no solution if there are two traitors
- very huge in cryptography

>> Consensus Protocal Defense Against Attackers <<
-- Challenge 1 Attacker --
- multiple consensus protocals POW(Proof of Work), POS(Proof of Stake), Other
- financial incentive for minersr to mine and to play fair because they worked hard for it
- there are also numerous checks for miners before the blockchain accepts the block
- cryptographic puzzles hard to solve - easy to vertify
-- Challenge 2 Competing Chains --
- when people mine the same block at the same time
- thats when the byzantine fault tolerance comes into play the network with more hash rate or the longer network will get the block if the there are multiple networks competing or (50% hash power)
- coinbase is where the money originates
